pursued and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this . object were the plan of the convention adverse to the public , happiness my voice would , be reject the . plan were the union itself inconsistent with the public , happiness it would , be abolish the . union in like , manner as far as the sovereignty of the states cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the , people the voice of every good citizen must , be let the former be sacrificed to the . latter how far the sacrifice is , necessary has been . shown how far the unsacrificed residue will be , endangered is the question before . us several important considerations have been touched in the course of these , papers which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the state . governments the more i revolve the , subject the more fully i am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first . scale we have , seen in all the examples of ancient and modern , confederacies the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the , members to despoil the general government of its , authorities with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the . encroachments , although in most of these , examples the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the , former , yet as the states will , retain under the proposed , constitution a very extensive portion of active , sovereignty the inference ought not to be wholly . disregarded in the achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of , power which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the . convention the lycian , confederacy as far as its principles and form are , transmitted must have borne a still greater analogy to . it yet history does not inform us that either of them ever , degenerated or tended to , degenerate into one consolidated . government on the , contrary we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the , dissensions and finally the , disunion of the subordinate . authorities these cases are the more worthy of our , attention as the external causes by which the component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and powerful than in our ; case and consequently less powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the , head and to each . other in the feudal , system we have seen a similar propensity . exemplified notwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns and the , people and the sympathy in some instances between the general sovereign and the , latter it usually happened that the local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for . encroachments had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and , subordination and , particularly had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the , people the great kingdoms in europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory . barons the state governments will have the advantage of the federal , government whether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on the ; other to the weight of personal influence which each side will ; possess to the powers respectively vested in ; them to the predilection and probable support of the ; people to the disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each . other the state governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of the federal ; government whilst the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization of the . former without the intervention of the state , legislatures the president of the united states cannot be elected at . all they must in all cases have a great share in his , appointment and , will , perhaps in most , cases of themselves determine . it the senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the state . legislatures even the house of , representatives though drawn immediately from the , people will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of , men whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election into the state . legislatures , thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the state , governments and must consequently feel a , dependence which is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards . them on the other , side the component parts of the state governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal , government and very , little if at , all to the local influence of its . members the number of individuals employed under the constitution of the united states will be much smaller than the number employed under the particular . states there will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former than of the . latter the members of the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more , states the justices of , peace officers of , militia ministerial officers of , justice with all the , county , corporation and town , officers for three millions and more of , people , intermixed and having particular acquaintance with every class and circle of , people must , exceed beyond all , proportion both in number and , influence those of every description who will be employed in the administration of the federal . system compare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen , states excluding from the judiciary department the justices of , peace with the members of the corresponding departments of the single government of the ; union compare the militia officers of three millions of people with the military and marine officers of any establishment which is within the compass of , probability , or i may , add of , possibility and in this view , alone we may pronounce the advantage of the states to be . decisive if the federal government is to have collectors of , revenue the state governments will have theirs . also and as those of the former will be principally on the , seacoast and not very , numerous whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the , country and will be very , numerous the advantage in this view also lies on the same . side it is , true that the confederacy is to , possess and may , exercise the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the ; states but it is probable that this power will not be resorted , to except for supplemental purposes of ; revenue that an option will then be given to the states to supply their quotas by previous collections of their ; own and that the eventual , collection under the immediate authority of the , union will generally be made by the , officers and according to the , rules appointed by the several . states indeed it is extremely , probable that in other , instances particularly in the organization of the judicial , power the officers of the states will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the . union should it , happen , however that separate collectors of internal revenue should be appointed under the federal , government the influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of state officers in the opposite . scale within every district to which a federal collector would be , allotted there would not be less than thirty or , forty or even , more officers of different , descriptions and many of them persons of character and , weight whose influence would lie on the side of the . state the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal , government are few and . defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and . indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external , objects as , war , peace , negotiation and foreign ; commerce with which last the power of taxation , will for the most , part be . connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects , which in the ordinary course of , affairs concern the , lives , liberties and properties of the , people and the internal , order , improvement and prosperity of the . state the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and ; danger those of the state , governments in times of peace and . security as the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the , latter the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal . government the more , adequate , indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national , defense the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular . states if the new constitution be examined with accuracy and , candor it will be found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of new powers to the , union than in the invigoration of its original . powers the regulation of , commerce it is , true is a new ; power but that seems to be an addition which few , oppose and from which no apprehensions are . entertained the powers relating to war and , peace armies and , fleets treaties and , finance with the other more considerable , powers are all vested in the existing congress by the articles of . confederation the proposed change does not enlarge these ;

       "       'having reviewed the general form of the proposed government and the general mass of power allotted to , it i proceed to examine the particular structure of this , government and the distribution of this mass of power among its constituent . parts one of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the , constitution is its supposed violation of the political , maxim that the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments ought to be separate and . distinct in the structure of the federal , government no , regard it is , said seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of . liberty the several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of , form and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other . parts no political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic , value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of , liberty than that on which the objection is . founded the accumulation of all , powers , legislative , executive and , judiciary in the same , hands whether of , one a , few or , many and whether , hereditary , self-appointed or , elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of . tyranny were the federal , constitution , therefore really chargeable with the accumulation of , power or with a mixture of , powers having a dangerous tendency to such an , accumulation no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the . system i persuade , myself , however that it will be made apparent to every , one that the charge cannot be , supported and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally misconceived and . misapplied in order to form correct ideas on this important , subject it will be proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and . distinct the oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the celebrated . montesquieu if he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of , politics he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of . mankind let us , endeavor in the first , place to ascertain his meaning on this . point the british constitution was to montesquieu what homer has been to the didactic writers on epic . poetry as the latter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be , drawn and by which all similar works were to be , judged so this great political critic appears to have viewed the constitution of england as the , standard or to use his own , expression as the mirror of political ; liberty and to have , delivered in the form of elementary , truths the several characteristic principles of that particular . system that we may be , sure , then not to mistake his meaning in this , case let us recur to the source from which the maxim was . drawn on the slightest view of the british , constitution we must perceive that the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each . other the executive magistrate forms an integral part of the legislative . authority he alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign , sovereigns , which when , made , have under certain , limitations the force of legislative . acts all the members of the judiciary department are appointed by , him can be removed by him on the address of the two houses of , parliament and , form when he pleases to consult , them one of his constitutional . councils one branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional council to the executive , chief , as on another , hand it is the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of , impeachment and is invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other . cases the , judges , again are so far connected with the legislative department as often to attend and participate in its , deliberations though not admitted to a legislative . vote from these , facts by which montesquieu was , guided it may clearly be inferred , that in saying \"there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same , person or body of magistrates,\" , or \"if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers,\" he did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency , in or no control , over the acts of each . other his , meaning as his own words , import and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his , eye can amount to no more than , this that where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of another , department the fundamental principles of a free constitution are . subverted this would have been the case in the constitution examined by , him if the , king who is the sole executive , magistrate had possessed also the complete legislative , power or the supreme administration of ; justice or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme , judiciary or the supreme executive . authority , this , however is not among the vices of that . constitution the magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a , law though he can put a negative on every ; law nor administer justice in , person though he has the appointment of those who do administer . it the judges can exercise no executive , prerogative though they are shoots from the executive ; stock nor any legislative , function though they may be advised with by the legislative . councils the entire legislature can perform no judiciary , act though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their , offices and though one of its branches is possessed of the judicial power in the last . resort the entire , legislature , again can exercise no executive , prerogative though one of its branches constitutes the supreme executive , magistracy and , another on the impeachment of a , third can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the executive . department the reasons on which montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his . meaning \"when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body,\" says , he \"there can be no , liberty because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\" again: \"were the power of judging joined with the , legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary , control for the judge would then be the . legislator were it joined to the executive , power the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor.\" some of these reasons are more fully explained in other ; passages but briefly stated as they are , here they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated . author if we look into the constitutions of the several , states we find , that notwithstanding the emphatical , and in some , instances the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid , down there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and . distinct new , hampshire whose constitution was the last , formed seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these , departments and has qualified the doctrine by declaring \"that the , legislative , executive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate , from and independent , of each other as the nature of a free government will ; admit or as is consistent with that chain of connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of unity and amity.\" her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in several . respects the , senate which is a branch of the legislative , department is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of . impeachments the , president who is the head of the executive , department is the presiding member also of the ; senate , and besides an equal vote in all , cases has a casting vote in case of a . tie the executive head is himself eventually elective every year by the legislative , department and his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same . department several of the officers of state are also appointed by the . legislature and the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive . department the constitution of massachusetts has observed a sufficient though less pointed , caution in expressing this fundamental article of . liberty it declares \"that the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial , powers or either of ; them the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial , powers or either of ; them the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive , powers or either of them.\" this declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of , montesquieu as it has been , explained and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the . convention it goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers of another . department in the very constitution to which it is , prefixed a partial mixture of powers has been . admitted the executive magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative , body and the , senate which is a part of the , legislature is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary . departments the members of the judiciary , department , again are appointable by the executive , department and removable by the same authority on the address of the two legislative . branches , lastly a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legislative . department as the appointment to , offices particularly executive , offices is in its nature an executive , function the compilers of the constitution , have in this last point at , least violated the rule established by . themselves i pass over the constitutions of rhode island and , connecticut because they were formed prior to the , revolution and even before the principle under examination had become an object of political . attention the constitution of new york contains no declaration on this ; subject but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of improperly blending the different . departments it , gives , nevertheless to the executive , magistrate a partial control over the legislative ; department , and what is , more gives a like control to the judiciary ; department and even blends the executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this . control in its council of appointment members of the legislative are associated with the executive , authority in the appointment of , officers both executive and . judiciary and its court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal members of the judiciary . department the constitution of new jersey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the . preceding the , governor who is the executive , magistrate is appointed by the ; legislature is chancellor and , ordinary or surrogate of the ; state is a member of the supreme court of , appeals and , president with a casting , vote of one of the legislative . branches the same legislative branch acts again as executive council of the , governor and with him constitutes the court of . appeals the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legislative department and removable by one branch of , it on the impeachment of the . other according to the constitution of , pennsylvania the , president who is the head of the executive , department is annually elected by a vote in which the legislative department . predominates in conjunction with an executive , council he appoints the members of the judiciary , department and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all , officers judiciary as well as . executive the judges of the supreme court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable by the ; legislature and the executive power of pardoning in certain , cases to be referred to the same . department the members of the executive council are made ex-officio justices of peace throughout the . state in , delaware the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the legislative . department the speakers of the two legislative branches are vice-presidents in the executive . department the executive , chief with six , others , appointed three by each of the legislative branches constitutes the supreme court of ; appeals he is joined with the legislative department in the appointment of the other . judges throughout the , states it appears that the members of the legislature may at the same time be justices of the ; peace in this , state the members of one branch of it are ex-officio justices of the ; peace as are also the members of the executive . council the principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the ; legislative and one branch of the latter forms a court of . impeachments all officers may be removed on address of the . legislature maryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified ; terms declaring that the , legislative , executive and judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each . other her , constitution , notwithstanding makes the executive magistrate appointable by the legislative ; department and the members of the judiciary by the executive . department the language of virginia is still more pointed on this . subject her constitution , declares \"that the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and ; distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the ; other nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same , time except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either house of assembly.\" yet we find not only this express , exception with respect to the members of the inferior , courts but that the chief , magistrate with his executive , council are appointable by the ; legislature that two members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure of the ; legislature and that all the principal , offices both executive and , judiciary are filled by the same . department the executive prerogative of , pardon , also is in one case vested in the legislative . department the constitution of north , carolina which declares \"that the , legislative , executive and supreme judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other,\" , refers at the same , time to the legislative , department the appointment not only of the executive , chief but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary . department in south , carolina the constitution makes the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative . department it gives to the , latter , also the appointment of the members of the judiciary , department including even justices of the peace and ; sheriffs and the appointment of officers in the executive , department down to captains in the army and navy of the . state in the constitution of , georgia where it is declared \"that the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and , distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other,\" we find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the ; legislature and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised by the same . authority even justices of the peace are to be appointed by the . legislature in citing these , cases in which the , legislative , executive and judiciary departments have not been kept totally separate and , distinct i wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the several state . governments i am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they , exemplify they carry strong marks of the , haste and still stronger of the , inexperience under which they were . framed it is but too obvious that in some instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been violated by too great a , mixture and even an actual , consolidation of the different ; powers and that in no instance has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice the separation delineated on . paper what i have wished to evince , is that the charge brought against the proposed , constitution of violating the sacred maxim of free , government is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its , author nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in . america this interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing . paper publius',\n",
       "       'we have seen the necessity of the , union as our bulwark against foreign , danger as the conservator of peace among , ourselves as the guardian of our commerce and other common , interests as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the old , world and as the proper antidote for the diseases of , faction which have proved fatal to other popular , governments and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our . own all that , remains within this branch of our , inquiries is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union . embraces a few observations on this subject will be the more , proper as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican , administration in order to , supply by imaginary , difficulties the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to . find the error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding . papers i remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a , democracy applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the . latter the true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former . occasion it , is that in a , democracy the people meet and exercise the government in ; person in a , republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and . agents a , democracy , consequently will be confined to a small . spot a republic may be extended over a large . region to this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated , authors whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political . opinions being subjects either of an absolute or limited , monarchy they have endeavored to heighten the , advantages or palliate the evils of those , forms by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the , republican and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient greece and modern . italy under the confusion of , names it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy ; only and among , others the observation that it can never be established but among a small number of , people living within a small compass of . territory such a fallacy may have been the less , perceived as most of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic ; species and even in modern , europe to which we owe the great principle of , representation no example is seen of a government wholly , popular and , founded at the same , time wholly on that . principle if europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in , government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be , concentred and its force directed to any object which the public good , requires america can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive . republics it is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her . consideration as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions , demand and will include no greater number than can join in those ; functions so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public . affairs can it be said that the limits of the united states exceed this ? distance it will not be said by those who recollect that the atlantic coast is the longest side of the , union that during the term of thirteen , years the representatives of the states have been almost continually , assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from the states in the neighborhood of . congress that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting , subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the . union the , limits as fixed by the treaty of , peace are: on the east the , atlantic on the south the latitude of thirty-one , degrees on the west the , mississippi and on the north an irregular line running in some instances beyond the forty-fifth , degree in others falling as low as the . forty-second the southern shore of lake erie lies below that . latitude computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth , degrees it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common ; miles computing it from thirty-one to forty-two , degrees to seven hundred and sixty-four miles and a . half taking the mean for the , distance the amount will be eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and . three-fourths the mean distance from the atlantic to the mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty . miles on a comparison of this extent with that of several countries in , europe the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be . demonstrable it is not a great deal larger than , germany where a diet representing the whole empire is continually ; assembled or than poland before the late , dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme . power passing by france and , spain we find that in great , britain inferior as it may be in , size the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the . union favorable as this view of the subject may , be some observations remain which will place it in a light still more . satisfactory in the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering . laws its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated , objects which concern all the members of the , republic but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of . any the subordinate , governments which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided , for will retain their due authority and . activity were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular , states its adversaries would have some ground for their ; objection though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be , compelled by the principle of , self-preservation to reinstate them in their proper . jurisdiction a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive , states which we know to be ; practicable and to add to them such other states as may arise in their own , bosoms or in their , neighborhoods which we cannot doubt to be equally . practicable the arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern , frontier must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the . task let it be , remarked in the third , place that the intercourse throughout the union will be facilitated by new . improvements roads will everywhere be , shortened and kept in better ; order accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and ; meliorated an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened , throughout or nearly , throughout the whole extent of the thirteen . states the communication between the western and atlantic , districts and between different parts of , each will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our , country and which art finds it so little difficult to connect and . complete a fourth and still more important consideration , is that as almost every state , will on one side or , other be a , frontier and will thus , find in regard to its , safety an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general ; protection so the states which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the , union and , which of , course may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its , benefits will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign , nations and will consequently , stand on particular , occasions in greatest need of its strength and . resources it may be inconvenient for , georgia or the states forming our western or northeastern , borders to send their representatives to the seat of ; government but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading , enemy or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual . danger if they should derive less , benefit , therefore from the union in some respects than the less distant , states they will derive greater benefit from it in other , respects and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained . throughout i submit to , you my , fellow-citizens these , considerations in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and ; effect and that you will never suffer , difficulties however formidable in , appearance or however fashionable the error on which they may be , founded to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct . you hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of , america knit together as they are by so many cords of , affection can no longer live together as members of the same ; family can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual ; happiness can no longer be fellow citizens of one , great , respectable and flourishing . empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political ;

       "       'the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two general points of . view the first relates to the sum or quantity of power which it vests in the , government including the restraints imposed on the . states the , second to the particular structure of the , government and the distribution of this power among its several . branches under the first view of the , subject two important questions arise: . DG whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unnecessary or ? improper . DG whether the entire mass of them be dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several ? states is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in ? it this is the first . question it cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of the , government that the authors of them have very little considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining a necessary . end they have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political ; advantages and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or , trust of which a beneficial use can be . made this method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of the people of . america it may display the subtlety of the ; writer it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and ; declamation it may inflame the passions of the , unthinking and may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking: but cool and candid people will at once , reflect that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in ; them that the choice must always be , made if not of the lesser , evil at least of the , greater not the , perfect ; good and that in every political , institution a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and . abused they will , see , therefore that in all cases where power is to be , conferred the point first to be decided , is whether such a power be necessary to the public ; good as the next will , be in case of an affirmative , decision to guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power to the public . detriment that we may form a correct judgment on this , subject it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the government of the ; union and that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following different objects: . DG security against foreign ; danger . DG regulation of the intercourse with foreign ; nations . DG maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the ; states . DG certain miscellaneous objects of general ; utility . DG restraint of the states from certain injurious ; acts . DG provisions for giving due efficacy to all these . powers the powers falling within the first class are those of declaring war and granting letters of ; marque of providing armies and ; fleets of regulating and calling forth the ; militia of levying and borrowing . money security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil . society it is an avowed and essential object of the american . union the powers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the federal . councils is the power of declaring war ? necessary no man will answer this question in the . negative it would be , superfluous , therefore to enter into a proof of the . affirmative the existing confederation establishes this power in the most ample . form is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets ? necessary this is involved in the foregoing . power it is involved in the power of . self-defense but was it necessary to give an indefinite power of raising , troops as well as providing ; fleets and of maintaining both in , peace as well as in ? war the answer to these questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit an extensive discussion of them in this . place the answer indeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any . place with what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of ? offense if a federal constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other , nations then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own , government and set bounds to the exertions for its own . safety how could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely , prohibited unless we could , prohibit in like , manner the preparations and establishments of every hostile ? nation the means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of . attack they , will in , fact be ever determined by these , rules and by no . others it is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of . self-preservation it is worse than in ; vain because it plants in the constitution itself necessary usurpations of , power every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied . repetitions if one nation maintains constantly a disciplined , army ready for the service of ambition or , revenge it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding . precautions the fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the time of . peace they were introduced by charles . vii of . france all europe has , followed or been forced , into the . example had the example not been followed by other , nations all europe must long ago have worn the chains of a universal . monarch were every nation except france now to disband its peace , establishments the same event might . follow the veteran legions of rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the . world not the less true is , it that the liberties of rome proved the final victim to her military ; triumphs and that the liberties of , europe as far as they ever , existed , have with few , exceptions been the price of her military . establishments a standing , force , therefore is a , dangerous at the same time that it may be a , necessary . provision on the smallest scale it has its . inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be . fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and . precaution a wise nation will combine all these ;

legislature whereas the american constitution has lengthened this critical period to two . years this is the form in which the comparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a just ? form is it a fair ? comparison does the british constitution restrain the parliamentary discretion to one ? year does the american impose on the congress appropriations for two ? years on the , contrary it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy , themselves that the british constitution fixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the , legislature and that the american ties down the legislature to two , years as the longest admissible . term had the argument from the british example been truly , stated it would have stood thus: the term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army , establishment though unlimited by the british , constitution has , nevertheless in , practice been limited by parliamentary discretion to a single . year , now if in great , britain where the house of commons is elected for seven ; years where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the ; people where the electors are so corrupted by the , representatives and the representatives so corrupted by the , crown the representative body can possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite , term without , desiring or without , daring to extend the term beyond a single , year ought not suspicion herself to , blush in pretending that the representatives of the united , states elected freely by the whole body of the , people every second , year cannot be safely intrusted with the discretion over such , appropriations expressly limited to the short period of two ? years a bad cause seldom fails to betray . itself of this , truth the management of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried . exemplification but among all the blunders which have been , committed none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the , people of standing . armies the attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important ; subject and has led to investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal , conviction not only that the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against danger from that , quarter but that nothing short of a constitution fully adequate to the national defense and the preservation of the , union can save america from as many standing armies as it may be split into states or , confederacies and from such a progressive , augmentation of these establishments in , each as will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the , people as any establishment that can become , necessary under a united and efficient , government must be tolerable to the former and safe to the . latter the palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution against a spirit of , censure which has spared few other . parts it , must , indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of , america that as her union will be the only source of her maritime , strength so this will be a principal source of her security against danger from . abroad in this respect our situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of great . britain the batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our , safety are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government against our . liberties the inhabitants of the atlantic frontier are all of them deeply interested in this provision for naval , protection and if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their ; beds if their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious ; adventurers if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a , conflagration by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden , invaders these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom it claims , allegiance but to causes that are fugitive and . fallacious if we except perhaps virginia and , maryland which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern , frontiers no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this subject than new . york her seacoast is . extensive a very important district of the state is an . island the state itself is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty . leagues the great emporium of its , commerce the great reservoir of its , wealth lies every moment at the mercy of , events and may almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign , enemy or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and . barbarians should a war be the result of the precarious situation of european , affairs and all the unruly passions attending it be let loose on the , ocean our escape from insults and , depredations not only on that , element but every part of the other bordering on , it will be truly . miraculous in the present condition of , america the states more immediately exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now ;

imports and that these variations do not correspond with the progress of , population which must be the general measure of the public . wants as long as agriculture continues the sole field of , labor the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers . multiply as soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands not called for by , agriculture the imported manufactures will decrease as the numbers of people . increase in a more remote , stage the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw , materials which will be wrought into articles for , exportation and , will , therefore require rather the encouragement of , bounties than to be loaded with discouraging . duties a system of , government meant for , duration ought to contemplate these , revolutions and be able to accommodate itself to . them , some who have not denied the necessity of the power of , taxation have grounded a very fierce attack against the , constitution on the language in which it is . defined it has been urged and , echoed that the power \"to lay and collect , taxes , duties , imposts and , excises to pay the , debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states,\" amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general . welfare no stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for , objections than their stooping to such a . misconstruction had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congress been found in the , constitution than the general expressions just , cited the authors of the objection might have had some color for ; it though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible . cases a power to destroy the freedom of the , press the trial by , jury or even to regulate the course of , descents or the forms of , conveyances must be very singularly expressed by the terms \"to raise money for the general welfare.\" but what color can the objection , have when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately , follows and is not even separated by a longer pause than a ? semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so , expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear , it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the ;

DG what relation is to subsist between the nine or more states ratifying the , constitution and the remaining few who do not become parties to ? it the first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the ; case to the great principle of ; self-preservation to the transcendent law of nature and of nature\\'s , god which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions , aim and to which all such institutions must be . sacrificed , perhaps , also an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact . itself it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the , confederation that in many of the states it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative . ratification the principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation on the other states should be reduced to the same . standard a compact between independent , sovereigns founded on ordinary acts of legislative , authority can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the . parties it is an established doctrine on the subject of , treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each ; other that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole ; treaty and that a , breach committed by either of the , parties absolves the , others and authorizes , them if they , please to pronounce the compact violated and . void should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular states to a dissolution of the federal , pact will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be ? confronted the time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph . exhibits the scene is now , changed and with it the part which the same motives . dictate the second question is not less ; delicate and the flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of . it it is one of those cases which must be left to provide for . itself in , general it may be , observed that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting , states yet the moral relations will remain . uncancelled the claims of , justice both on one side and on the , other will be in , force and must be ; fulfilled the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually ; respected whilst considerations of a common , interest , and above , all the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are , past and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to , reunion , will it is , hoped not urge in vain moderation on one , side and prudence on the . other publius',\n",
       "       'it is sometimes , asked with an air of seeming , triumph what inducements could the states , have if , disunited to make war upon each ? other it would be a full answer to this question to say--precisely the same inducements which , have at different , times deluged in blood all the nations in the . world , but unfortunately for , us the question admits of a more particular . answer there are causes of differences within our immediate , contemplation of the tendency of , which even under the restraints of a federal , constitution we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were . removed territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most fertile sources of hostility among . nations perhaps the greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this . origin this cause would exist among us in full . force we have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the united . states there still are discordant and undecided claims between several of , them and the dissolution of the union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them . all it is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the , revolution and which usually went under the name of crown . lands the states within the limits of whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their , property the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the ;

       "       'let us now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different , courts and their relations to each . other \"the judicial power of the united states is\" (by the plan of the convention) \"to be vested in one supreme , court and in such inferior courts as the congress , may from time to , time ordain and establish.\"(1) that there ought to be one court of supreme and final , jurisdiction is a proposition which is not likely to be . contested the reasons for it have been assigned in another , place and are too obvious to need . repetition the only question that seems to have been raised concerning , it , is whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the . legislature the same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in several other . cases the very men who object to the senate as a court of , impeachments on the ground of an improper intermixture of , powers , advocate by implication at , least the propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all , causes in the whole or in a part of the legislative . body the , arguments or rather , suggestions upon which this charge is , founded are to this effect: \"the authority of the proposed supreme court of the united , states which is to be a separate and independent , body will be superior to that of the . legislature the power of construing the laws according to the spirit of the , constitution will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think ; proper especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative . body this is as unprecedented as it is . dangerous in , britain the judicial , power in the last , resort resides in the house of , lords which is a branch of the ; legislature and this part of the british government has been imitated in the state constitutions in . general the parliament of great , britain and the legislatures of the several , states can at any time , rectify by , law the exceptionable decisions of their respective . courts but the errors and usurpations of the supreme court of the united states will be uncontrollable and remediless.\" , this upon , examination will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived . fact in the first , place there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the , constitution or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every . state i , admit , however that the constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the , laws and that wherever there is an evident , opposition the laws ought to give place to the . constitution but this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the , convention but from the general theory of a limited ; constitution and as far as it is , true is equally applicable to , most if not to all the state . governments there can be no , objection , therefore on this , account to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in , general and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative . discretion but perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular organization of the supreme ; court in its being composed of a distinct body of , magistrates instead of being one of the branches of the , legislature as in the government of great britain and that of the . state to insist upon this , point the authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated , maxim requiring a separation of the departments of . power it , shall , nevertheless be conceded to , them agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these , papers that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a part of the legislative . body but though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent , rule yet it verges so nearly upon , it as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the . convention from a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad , laws we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the . application the same spirit which had operated in making , them would be too apt in interpreting ; them still less could it be expected that men who had infringed the constitution in the character of , legislators would be disposed to repair the breach in the character of . judges nor is this . all every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial , offices militates against placing the judiciary , power in the last , resort in a body composed of men chosen for a limited . period there is an absurdity in referring the determination of , causes in the first , instance to judges of permanent ; standing in the , last to those of a temporary and mutable . constitution and there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of , men selected for their knowledge of the , laws acquired by long and laborious , study to the revision and control of men , who for want of the same , advantage cannot but be deficient in that . knowledge the members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of ; judges and , as on this , account there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective , information , so on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party , divisions there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of . justice the habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of . equity these considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those states who have committed the judicial , power in the last , resort not to a part of the , legislature but to distinct and independent bodies of . men contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the , convention in this , respect as novel and , unprecedented it is but a copy of the constitutions of new , hampshire , massachusetts , pennsylvania , delaware , maryland , virginia north , carolina south , carolina and ; georgia and the preference which has been given to those models is highly to be . commended it is not , true in the second , place that the parliament of great , britain or the legislatures of the particular , states can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective , courts in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the united . states the , theory neither of the , british nor the state , constitutions authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative . act nor is there any thing in the proposed , constitution more than in either of , them by which it is . forbidden in the , former as well as in the , latter the impropriety of the , thing on the general principles of law and , reason is the sole . obstacle a , legislature without exceeding its , province cannot reverse a determination once made in a particular ; case though it may prescribe a new rule for future . cases this is the , principle and it applies in all its , consequences exactly in the same manner and , extent to the state , governments as to the national government now under . consideration not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the . subject it may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative , authority which has been upon many occasions , reiterated is in reality a . phantom particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then ; happen but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an , inconvenience or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political . system this may be inferred with , certainty from the general nature of the judicial , power from the objects to which it , relates from the manner in which it is , exercised from its comparative , weakness and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by . force and the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative , body and of determining upon them in the , other would give to that body upon the members of the judicial . department this is alone a complete . security there never can be danger that the , judges by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the , legislature would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with , it while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their , presumption by degrading them from their . stations while this ought to remove all apprehensions on the , subject it , affords at the same , time a cogent argument for constituting the senate a court for the trial of . impeachments having now , examined , and i , trust removed the objections to the distinct and independent organization of the supreme , court i proceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior courts,(2) and the relations which will subsist between these and the . former the power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the supreme court in every case of federal . cognizance it is intended to enable the national government to institute or , authorize in each state or district of the united , states a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national jurisdiction within its . limits but , why it is , asked might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the instrumentality of the state ? courts this admits of different . answers though the fitness and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost , latitude yet the substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the , plan if it were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out of the national . constitution to confer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the several , states would perhaps be as much \"to constitute tribunals,\" as to create new courts with the like . power but ought not a more direct and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the state ? courts there , are in my , opinion substantial reasons against such a provision: the most discerning cannot foresee how far the prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the jurisdiction of national ; causes whilst every man may , discover that courts constituted like those of some of the states would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the . union state , judges holding their offices during , pleasure or from year to , year will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national . laws and if there was a necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as . possible in proportion to the grounds of confidence , in or distrust , of the subordinate , tribunals ought to be the facility or difficulty of . appeals and well satisfied as i am of the propriety of the appellate , jurisdiction in the several classes of causes to which it is extended by the plan of the . convention i should consider every thing calculated to , give in , practice an unrestrained course to , appeals as a source of public and private . inconvenience i am not , sure but that it will be found highly expedient and , useful to divide the united states into four or five or half a dozen ; districts and to institute a federal court in each , district in lieu of one in every . state the judges of these , courts with the aid of the state , judges may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts of the respective . districts justice through them may be administered with ease and ; despatch and appeals may be safely circumscribed within a narrow . compass this plan appears to me at present the most eligible of any that could be ; adopted and in order to , it it is necessary that the power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be found in the proposed . constitution these reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid , mind that the want of such a power would have been a great defect in the . plan let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the . union the supreme court is to be invested with original , jurisdiction only \"in cases affecting , ambassadors other public , ministers and , consuls and those in which a state shall be a party.\" public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their . sovereigns all questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the public , peace , that as well for the preservation of , this as out of respect to the sovereignties they , represent it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the . nation though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic , character yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they , belong the same observation is in a great measure applicable to . them in cases in which a state might happen to be a , party it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior . tribunal though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this , paper i shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken . grounds it has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one state to the citizens of , another would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those ; securities a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without . foundation it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its . consent this is the general , sense and the general practice of ; mankind and the , exemption as one of the attributes of , sovereignty is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the . union , unless , therefore there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the , convention it will remain with the , states and the danger intimated must be merely . ideal the circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of , taxation and need not be repeated . here a recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy , us that there is no color to pretend that the state governments , would by the adoption of that , plan be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own , way free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good . faith the contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the , sovereign and have no pretensions to a compulsive . force they confer no right of , action independent of the sovereign . will to what purpose would it be to authorize suits against states for the debts they ? owe how could recoveries be ? enforced it is , evident it could not be done without waging war against the contracting ; state and to ascribe to the federal , courts by mere , implication and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state , governments a power which would involve such a , consequence would be altogether forced and . unwarrantable let us resume the train of our . observations we have seen that the original jurisdiction of the supreme court would be confined to two classes of , causes and those of a nature rarely to . occur in all other cases of federal , cognizance the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior ; tribunals and the supreme court would have nothing more than an appellate , jurisdiction \"with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make.\" the propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of ; law but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of . fact some well-intentioned men in this , state deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our , courts have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by , jury in favor of the civil-law mode of , trial which prevails in our courts of , admiralty , probate and . chancery a technical sense has been affixed to the term \"appellate,\" , which in our law , parlance is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil . law but if i am not , misinformed the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of new . england there an appeal from one jury to , another is familiar both in language and , practice and is even a matter of , course until there have been two verdicts on one . side the word \"appellate,\" , therefore will not be understood in the same sense in new england as in new , york which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular . state the , expression taken in the , abstract denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of , another either as to the law or , fact or . both the mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the , latter) and may be with or without the aid of a , jury as may be judged . advisable , if , therefore the re-examination of a fact once determined by a , jury should in any case be admitted under the proposed , constitution it may be so regulated as to be done by a second , jury either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the , fact or by directing an issue immediately out of the supreme . court but it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a , jury will be permitted in the supreme . court why may not it be , said with the strictest , propriety when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this , state that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the ? law it is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the , fact but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the , record and pronounces the law arising upon it.(3) this is jurisdiction of both fact and ; law nor is it even possible to separate . them though the common-law courts of this state ascertain disputed facts by a , jury yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact and ; law and accordingly when the former is agreed in the , pleadings they have no recourse to a , jury but proceed at once to . judgment i , contend , therefore on this , ground that the , expressions \"appellate , jurisdiction both as to law and fact,\" do not necessarily imply a re-examination in the supreme court of facts decided by juries in the inferior . courts the following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the , convention in relation to this particular . provision the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (it may have been argued) will extend to causes determinable in different , modes some in the course of the common , law others in the course of the civil . law in the , former the revision of the law only will , be generally , speaking the proper province of the supreme ; court in the , latter the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to , usage and in some , cases of which prize causes are an , example might be essential to the preservation of the public . peace it is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction , should in certain , cases extend in the broadest sense to matters of . fact it will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a , jury because in the courts of some of the states all causes are tried in this ; mode(4) and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of , fact as well where it might be , proper as where it might be . improper to avoid all , inconveniencies it will be safest to declare , generally that the supreme court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and , fact and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the national legislature may . prescribe this will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of public justice and . security this view of the , matter at any , rate puts it out of all doubt that the supposed abolition of the trial by , jury by the operation of this , provision is fallacious and . untrue the legislature of the united states would certainly have full power to , provide that in appeals to the supreme court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original causes by . juries this would certainly be an authorized ; exception but , if for the reason already , intimated it should be thought too , extensive it might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of . trial the amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this: that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national ; judicature that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the supreme , court and the rest consigned to the subordinate ; tribunals that the supreme court will possess an appellate , jurisdiction both as to law and , fact in all the cases referred to , them both subject to any exceptions and regulations which may be thought ; advisable that this appellate jurisdiction , does in no , case abolish the trial by ; jury and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed , judiciary without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that . source publius .

       "       'the residue of the argument against the provisions of the constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following . clause the last clause of the eighth section of the first article of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers by that constitution vested in the government of the united , states or in any department or officer ; thereof\" and the second clause of the sixth article , declares \"that the constitution and the laws of the united states made in pursuance , thereof and the treaties made by their authority shall be the supreme law of the , land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\" these two clauses have been the source of much virulent invective and petulant declamation against the proposed . constitution they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be destroyed and their liberties ; exterminated as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex nor , age nor high nor , low nor sacred nor ; profane and , yet strange as it may , appear after all this , clamor to those who may not have happened to contemplate them in the same , light it may be affirmed with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the intended government would be precisely the , same if these clauses were entirely , obliterated as if they were repeated in every . article they are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a federal , government and vesting it with certain specified . powers this is so clear a , proposition that moderation itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so copiously vented against this part of the , plan without emotions that disturb its . equanimity what is a , power but the ability or faculty of doing a ? thing what is the ability to do a , thing but the power of employing the means necessary to its ? execution what is a legislative , power but a power of making ? laws what are the means to execute a legislative power but ? laws what is the power of laying and collecting , taxes but a legislative , power or a power of making , laws to lay and collect ? taxes what are the proper means of executing such a , power but necessary and proper ? laws this simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained . of it conducts us to this palpable , truth that a power to lay and collect taxes must be a power to pass all laws necessary and proper for the execution of that ; power and what does the unfortunate and calumniated provision in question do more than declare the same , truth to , wit that the national , legislature to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previously , given , might in the execution of that , power pass all laws necessary and proper to carry it into ? effect i have applied these observations thus particularly to the power of , taxation because it is the immediate subject under , consideration and because it is the most important of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the . union but the same process will lead to the same , result in relation to all other powers declared in the . constitution and it is expressly to execute these powers that the sweeping , clause as it has been affectedly , called authorizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and proper . laws if there is any thing , exceptionable it must be sought for in the specific powers upon which this general declaration is . predicated the declaration , itself though it may be chargeable with tautology or , redundancy is at least perfectly . harmless but suspicion may , ask why then was it ? introduced the answer , is that it could only have been done for greater , caution and to guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the . union the convention probably , foresaw what it has been a principal aim of these papers to , inculcate that the danger which most threatens our political welfare is that the state governments will finally sap the foundations of the ; union and might therefore think it , necessary in so cardinal a , point to leave nothing to . construction whatever may have been the inducement to , it the wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raised against ; it as that very cry betrays a disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to . declare but it may be again , asked who is to judge of the necessity and propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the ? union i , answer , first that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory ; clause and i , answer in the second , place that the national , government like every , other must , judge in the first , instance of the proper exercise of its , powers and its constituents in the . last if the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a tyrannical use of its , powers the , people whose creature it , is must appeal to the standard they have , formed and take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution as the exigency may suggest and prudence . justify the propriety of a , law in a constitutional , light must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is . founded , suppose by some forced constructions of its authority , (which , indeed cannot easily be , imagined) the federal legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any , state would it not be evident , that in making such an , attempt it had exceeded its , jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the ? state , suppose , again that upon the pretense of an interference with its , revenues it should undertake to abrogate a landtax imposed by the authority of a ; state would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of , tax which its constitution plainly supposes to exist in the state ? governments if there ever should be a doubt on this , head the credit of it will be entirely due to those reasoners , who in the imprudent zeal of their animosity to the plan of the , convention have labored to envelop it in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest . truths but it is said that the laws of the union are to be the supreme law of the . land but what inference can be drawn from , this or what would they amount , to if they were not to be ? supreme it is evident they would amount to . nothing a , law by the very meaning of the , term includes . supremacy it is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to . observe this results from every political . association if individuals enter into a state of , society the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator of their . conduct if a number of political societies enter into a larger political , society the laws which the latter may , enact pursuant to the powers intrusted to it by its , constitution must necessarily be supreme over those , societies and the individuals of whom they are . composed it would otherwise be a mere , treaty dependent on the good faith of the , parties and not a , government which is only another word for political power and . supremacy but it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are not pursuant to its constitutional , powers but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller , societies will become the supreme law of the . land these will be merely acts of , usurpation and will deserve to be treated as . such hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the , union like the one we have just before , considered only declares a , truth which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal . government it will , not i , presume have escaped , observation that it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the ; constitution which i mention merely as an instance of caution in the ; convention since that limitation would have been to be , understood though it had not been . expressed though a , law , therefore laying a tax for the use of the united states would be supreme in its , nature and could not legally be opposed or , controlled yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of the , state (unless upon imports and , exports) would not be the supreme law of the , land but a usurpation of power not granted by the . constitution as far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the collection difficult or , precarious this would be a mutual , inconvenience not arising from a superiority or defect of power on either , side but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the , other in a manner equally disadvantageous to . both it is to be hoped and , presumed , however that mutual interest would dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material . inconvenience the inference from the whole , is that the individual states , would under the proposed , constitution retain an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which they may stand in , need by every kind of , taxation except duties on imports and . exports it will be shown in the next paper that this concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire , subordination in respect to this branch of , power of the state authority to that of the . union publius',\n",
       "       'the remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the , senate in a distinct , capacity are comprised in their participation with the executive in the appointment to , offices and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of . impeachments as in the business of appointments the executive will be the principal , agent the provisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that . department we , will , therefore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the . senate a well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly . elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public , men , or in other , words from the abuse or violation of some public . trust they are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated , political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society . itself the prosecution of , them for this , reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole , community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the . accused in many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing , factions and will enlist all their , animosities , partialities , influence and interest on one side or on the ; other and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of , parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or . guilt the delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the administration of public , affairs speak for . themselves the difficulty of placing it , rightly in a government resting entirely on the basis of periodical , elections will as readily be , perceived when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it , will from that , circumstance be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous , faction and on this , account can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose conduct may be the subject of . scrutiny the , convention it , appears thought the senate the most fit depositary of this important . trust those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the , thing will be least hasty in condemning that , opinion and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced . it , what it may be , asked is the true spirit of the institution ? itself is it not designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public ? men if this be the design of , it who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation ? themselves it is not disputed that the power of originating the , inquiry , or in other , words of preferring the , impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative . body will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the ? inquiry the model from which the idea of this institution has been , borrowed pointed out that course to the . convention in great britain it is the province of the house of commons to prefer the , impeachment and of the house of lords to decide upon . it several of the state constitutions have followed the . example as well the , latter as the , former seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the . government is not this the true light in which it ought to be ? regarded where else than in the senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently , dignified or sufficiently ? independent what other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own , situation to , preserve unawed and , uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual , accused and the representatives of the , people his ? accusers could the supreme court have been relied upon as answering this ? description it is much to be , doubted whether the members of that tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of , fortitude as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a ; task and it is still more to be , doubted whether they would possess the degree of credit and , authority which , might on certain , occasions be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate . representatives a deficiency in the , first would be fatal to the ; accused in the , last dangerous to the public . tranquillity the hazard in both these , respects could only be , avoided if at , all by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable attention to . economy the necessity of a numerous court for the trial of , impeachments is equally dictated by the nature of the . proceeding this can never be tied down by such strict , rules either in the delineation of the offense by the , prosecutors or in the construction of it by the , judges as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal . security there will be no jury to stand between the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the , law and the party who is to receive or suffer . it the awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily , have to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the , community forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of . persons these considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a , conclusion that the supreme court would have been an improper substitute for the , senate as a court of . impeachments there remains a further , consideration which will not a little strengthen this . conclusion it is this: the punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon , impeachment is not to terminate the chastisement of the . offender after having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and , confidence and honors and emoluments of his , country he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of . law would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his , fame and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one , trial , should in another , trial for the same , offense be also the disposers of his life and his ? fortune would there not be the greatest reason to , apprehend that , error in the first , sentence would be the parent of error in the second ? sentence that the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another ? decision those who know anything of human , nature will not hesitate to answer these questions in the ; affirmative and will be at no loss to , perceive that by making the same persons judges in both , cases those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution , would in a great , measure be deprived of the double security intended them by a double . trial the loss of life and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence , which in its , terms imported nothing more than dismission from a , present and disqualification for a , future . office it may be , said that the intervention of a , jury in the second , instance would obviate the . danger but juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of . judges they are sometimes induced to find special , verdicts which refer the main question to the decision of the . court who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his ? guilt would it have been an improvement of the , plan to have united the supreme court with the , senate in the formation of the court of ? impeachments this union would certainly have been attended with several ; advantages but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal , disadvantage already , stated arising from the agency of the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be ? liable to a certain , extent the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief justice of the supreme court the president of the court of , impeachments as is proposed to be done in the plan of the ; convention while the inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially . avoided this was perhaps the prudent . mean i forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the , judiciary which so considerable an augmentation of its authority would have . afforded would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of , impeachments of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the ? government there are weighty , arguments as well , against as in favor , of such a . plan to some minds it will not appear a trivial , objection that it could tend to increase the complexity of the political , machine and to add a new spring to the , government the utility of which would at best be . questionable but an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of , attention is this: a court formed upon such a , plan would either be attended with a heavy , expense or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and . inconveniences it must either consist of permanent , officers stationary at the seat of , government and of course entitled to fixed and regular , stipends or of certain officers of the state governments to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually . depending it will not be easy to imagine any third mode materially , different which could rationally be . proposed as the , court for reasons already , given ought to be , numerous the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying . them the second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over the whole ; union the injury to the , innocent from the procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought against ; them the advantage to the , guilty from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and ; corruption and in some cases the detriment to the , state from the prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the house of . representatives though this latter supposition may seem , harsh and might not be likely often to be , verified yet it ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction , will at certain , seasons extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of . men but though one or the other of the substitutes which have been , examined or some other that might be , devised should be thought preferable to the plan in this , respect reported by the , convention it will not follow that the constitution ought for this reason to be . rejected if mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of , government until every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact standard of , perfection society would soon become a general scene of , anarchy and the world a . desert where is the standard of perfection to be ?

       "       'before we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power of taxation in the , union i shall make one general ; remark which , is that if the jurisdiction of the national , government in the article of , revenue should be restricted to particular , objects it would naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those . objects two evils would spring from this source: the oppression of particular branches of ; industry and an unequal distribution of the , taxes as well among the several states as among the citizens of the same . state , suppose as has been contended , for the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on , imports it is evident that the , government for want of being able to command other , resources would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an injurious . excess there are persons who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a ; length since the higher they , are the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant , consumption to produce a favorable balance of , trade and to promote domestic . manufactures but all extremes are pernicious in various . ways exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general spirit of ; smuggling which is always prejudicial to the fair , trader and eventually to the revenue itself: they tend to render other classes of the community , tributary in an improper , degree to the manufacturing , classes to whom they give a premature monopoly of the ; markets they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less ; advantage and in the last , place they oppress the , merchant who is often obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the . consumer when the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at , market the consumer generally pays the ; duty but when the markets happen to be , overstocked a great proportion falls upon the , merchant and sometimes not only exhausts his , profits but breaks in upon his . capital i am apt to think that a division of the , duty between the seller and the , buyer more often happens than is commonly . imagined it is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon . it the , merchant especially in a country of small commercial , capital is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more expeditious . sale the maxim that the consumer is the , payer is so much oftener true than the reverse of the , proposition that it is far more equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common , stock than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing . states but it is not so generally true as to render it , equitable that those duties should form the only national . fund when they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional tax upon the importing , state whose citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of . consumers in this view they are productive of inequality among the ; states which inequality would be increased with the increased extent of the . duties the confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would be attended with , inequality from a different , cause between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing . states the states which can go farthest towards the supply of their own , wants by their own , manufactures will , not according to their numbers or , wealth consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those states which are not in the same favorable . situation they would , not , therefore in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their . abilities to make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to , excises the proper objects of which are particular kinds of . manufactures new york is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the union to external taxation may be aware . of new york is an importing , state and is not likely speedily to , be to any great , extent a manufacturing . state she , would of , course suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the union to commercial . imposts so far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be , observed conformably to a remark made in another part of these , papers that the interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such an . extreme i readily admit that this would be the , case as long as other resources were ;

form and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is . addressed but when we come to dissect it with , attention it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair-sounding . words the object it seems to aim at , is in the first , place , impracticable and in the sense in which it is contended , for is . unnecessary i reserve for another place the discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the representative body in respect to , numbers and shall content myself with examining here the particular use which has been made of a contrary , supposition in reference to the immediate subject of our . inquiries the idea of an actual representation of all classes of the , people by persons of each , class is altogether . visionary unless it were expressly provided in the , constitution that each different occupation should send one or more , members the thing would never take place in . practice mechanics and manufacturers will always be , inclined with few , exceptions to give their votes to , merchants in preference to persons of their own professions or . trades those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and . industry many of , them , indeed are immediately connected with the operations of . commerce they know that the merchant is their natural patron and ; friend and they are , aware that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good , sense their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by . themselves they are sensible that their habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired , endowments without , which in a deliberative , assembly the greatest natural abilities are for the most part ; useless and that the influence and , weight and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public , councils unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading . interests these , considerations and many others that might be mentioned , prove and experience confirms , it that artisans and manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom they . recommend we must therefore consider merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the . community with regard to the learned , professions little need be ; observed they truly form no distinct interest in , society and according to their situation and , talents will be indiscriminately the objects of the confidence and choice of each , other and of other parts of the . community nothing remains but the landed ; interest and , this in a political , view and particularly in relation to , taxes i take to be perfectly , united from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest . tenant no tax can be laid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a single . acre every landholder will therefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as ; possible and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of . sympathy but if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling , farmer what reason is there to , conclude that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the ? last if we take fact as our , guide and look into our own senate and , assembly we shall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in ; both nor is this less the case in the , senate which consists of a smaller , number than in the , assembly which is composed of a greater . number where the qualifications of the electors are the , same whether they have to choose a small or a large , number their votes will fall upon those in whom they have most ; confidence whether these happen to be men of large , fortunes or of moderate , property or of no property at . all it is said to be , necessary that all classes of citizens should have some of their own number in the representative , body in order that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and attended . to but we have seen that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people . free where this is the , case the representative , body with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the , government will be composed of , landholders , merchants and men of the learned . professions but where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of ? men will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed ? property and will he , not from his own interest in that species of , property be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber ? it will not the merchant understand and be disposed to , cultivate as far as may be , proper the interests of the mechanic and manufacturing , arts to which his commerce is so nearly ? allied will not the man of the learned , profession who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of , industry be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between , them ready to promote , either so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the ? society if we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the , society and to which a wise administration will never be , inattentive is the man whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less likely to be a competent judge of their , nature , extent and foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and ? acquaintances is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the , people and who is dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public , honors should take care to inform himself of their dispositions and , inclinations and should be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his ? conduct this , dependence and the necessity of being bound , himself and his , posterity by the laws to which he gives his , assent are the , true and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the . constituent there is no part of the administration of government that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political , economy so much as the business of . taxation the man who understands those principles best will be least likely to resort to oppressive , expedients or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to the procurement of . revenue it might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always be the least . burdensome there can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of , taxation it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general , genius , habits and modes of thinking of the people at , large and with the resources of the . country and this is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the . people in any other sense the proposition has either no , meaning or an absurd . one and in that sense let every considerate citizen judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most likely to be . found publius',\n",
       "       'it has been , urged in different , shapes that a constitution of the kind proposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid of a military force to execute its . laws , this , however like most other things that have been alleged on that , side rests on mere general , assertion unsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the reasons upon which it is . founded as far as i have been able to divine the latent meaning of the , objectors it seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an internal . nature waiving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and , external let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that disinclination in the . people unless we presume at the same time that the powers of the general government will be worse administered than those of the state , government there seems to be no room for the presumption of , ill-will , disaffection or opposition in the . people i believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be proportioned to the goodness or badness of its . administration it must be admitted that there are exceptions to this ; rule but these exceptions depend so entirely on accidental , causes that they cannot be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or demerits of a . constitution these can only be judged of by general principles and . maxims various reasons have been , suggested in the course of these , papers to induce a probability that the general government will be better administered than the particular ; governments the principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present a greater , option or latitude of , choice to the ; people that through the medium of the state legislatures which are select bodies of , men and which are to appoint the members of the national senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and ; judgment that these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the national , councils and that they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of , faction and more out of the reach of those occasional , ill-humors or temporary prejudices and , propensities , which in smaller , societies frequently contaminate the public , councils beget injustice and oppression of a part of the , community and engender schemes , which though they gratify a momentary inclination or , desire terminate in general , distress , dissatisfaction and . disgust several additional reasons of considerable , force to fortify that , probability will occur when we come to , survey with a more critical , eye the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to . erect it will be sufficient here to , remark that until satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an , opinion that the federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the , people there can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the union will meet with any greater obstruction from , them or will stand in need of any other methods to enforce their , execution than the laws of the particular . members the hope of impunity is a strong incitement to ; sedition the dread of , punishment a proportionably strong discouragement to . it will not the government of the , union , which if possessed of a due degree of , power can call to its aid the collective resources of the whole , confederacy be more likely to repress the former sentiment and to inspire the , latter than that of a single , state which can only command the resources within ? itself a turbulent faction in a state may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in that ; state but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the . union if this reflection be , just there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the confederacy than to that of a single . member i , will in this , place hazard an , observation which will not be the less just because to some it may appear ; new which , is that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of , government the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political , life the more it is familiarized to their sight and to their , feelings the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs of the human , heart the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the . community man is very much a creature of . habit a thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his . mind a government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the . people the inference , is that the authority of the , union and the affections of the citizens towards , it will be , strengthened rather than , weakened by its extension to what are called matters of internal ; concern and will have less occasion to recur to , force in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its . agency the more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally , flow the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of . compulsion one , thing at all , events must be , evident that a government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using , force than that species of league contend for by most of its ; opponents the authority of which should only operate upon the states in their political or collective . capacities it has been shown that in such a confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but ; force that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the ; government and that as often as these , happen they can only be , redressed if at , all by war and . violence the plan reported by the , convention by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several , states will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of , each in the execution of its . laws it is easy to perceive that this will tend to , destroy in the common , apprehension all distinction between the sources from which they might ; proceed and will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of each , state in addition to the influence on public opinion which will result from the important consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole . union it merits particular attention in this , place that the laws of the , confederacy as to the enumerated and legitimate objects of its , jurisdiction will become the supreme law of the ; land to the observance of which all , officers , legislative , executive and , judicial in each , state will be bound by the sanctity of an . oath thus the , legislatures , courts and , magistrates of the respective , members will be incorporated into the operations of the national government as far as its just and constitutional authority ; extends and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws.(1) any man who will , pursue by his own , reflections the consequences of this , situation will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the , union if its powers are administered with a common share of . prudence if we will arbitrarily suppose the , contrary we may deduce any inferences we please from the ; supposition for it is certainly , possible by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the best government that ever , was or ever can be , instituted to provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest . excesses but though the adversaries of the proposed constitution should presume that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of public , good or to the obligations of , duty i would still ask them how the interests of , ambition or the views of , encroachment can be promoted by such a ?

       "       'the natural order of the subject leads us to , consider in this , place that provision of the constitution which authorizes the national legislature to , regulate in the last , resort the election of its own . members it is in these words: \"the , times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature ; thereof but the congress , may at any , time by , law make or alter such , regulations except as to the places of choosing senators.\"(1) this provision has not only been declaimed against by those who condemn the constitution in the , gross but it has been censured by those who have objected with less latitude and greater ; moderation , and in one instance it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of the . system i am greatly , mistaken , notwithstanding if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defensible than . this its propriety rests upon the evidence of this plain , proposition that every government ought to contain in itself the means of its own . preservation every just reasoner , will at first , sight approve an adherence to this , rule in the work of the ; convention and will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the work some particular , ingredient with which a rigid conformity to the rule was . incompatible even in this , case though he may acquiesce in the , necessity yet he will not cease to regard and to regret a departure from so fundamental a , principle as a portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of future , weakness and perhaps . anarchy it will not be , alleged that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the , constitution which would have been always applicable to every probable change in the situation of the ; country and it will therefore not be , denied that a discretionary power over elections ought to exist . somewhere it , will i , presume be as readily , conceded that there were only three ways in which this power could have been reasonably modified and disposed: that it must either have been lodged wholly in the national , legislature or wholly in the state , legislatures or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the . former the last mode , has with , reason been preferred by the . convention they have submitted the regulation of elections for the federal , government in the first , instance to the local ; administrations , which in ordinary , cases and when no improper views , prevail may be both more convenient and more ; satisfactory but they have reserved to the national authority a right to , interpose whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its . safety nothing can be more , evident than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national , government in the hands of the state , legislatures would leave the existence of the union entirely at their . mercy they could at any moment annihilate , it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its . affairs it is to little purpose to , say that a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take . place the constitutional possibility of the , thing without an equivalent for the , risk is an unanswerable . objection nor has any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that . risk the extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be dignified with that . character if we are in a humor to presume abuses of , power it is as fair to presume them on the part of the state governments as on the part of the general . government and as it is more consonant to the rules of a just , theory to trust the union with the care of its own , existence than to transfer that care to any other , hands if abuses of power are to be hazarded on the one side or on the , other it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be , placed than where it would unnaturally be . placed suppose an article had been introduced into the , constitution empowering the united states to regulate the elections for the particular , states would any man have hesitated to condemn , it both as an unwarrantable transposition of , power and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the state ? governments the violation of , principle in this , case would have required no ; comment , and to an unbiased , observer it will not be less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the national , government in a similar , respect to the pleasure of the state . governments an impartial view of the matter cannot fail to result in a , conviction that , each as far as , possible ought to depend on itself for its own . preservation as an objection to this , position it may be remarked that the constitution of the national senate would , involve in its full , extent the danger which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the state legislatures to regulate the federal . elections it may be , alleged that by declining the appointment of , senators they might at any time give a fatal blow to the ; union and from this it may be , inferred that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a , point there can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under . consideration the interest of each , state it may be , added to maintain its representation in the national , councils would be a complete security against an abuse of the . trust this , argument though , specious will , not upon , examination be found . solid it is certainly true that the state , legislatures by forbearing the appointment of , senators may destroy the national . government but it will not follow , that because they have a power to do this in one , instance they ought to have it in every . other there are cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far more , decisive without any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the , senate to recommend their admission into the . system so far as that construction may expose the union to the possibility of injury from the state , legislatures it is an ; evil but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without excluding the , states in their political , capacities wholly from a place in the organization of the national . government if this had been , done it would doubtless have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal ; principle and would certainly have deprived the state governments of that absolute safeguard which they will enjoy under this . provision but however wise it may have been to have submitted in this instance to an , inconvenience for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater , good no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the , evil where no necessity , urges nor any greater good . invites it may be easily discerned also that the national government would run a much greater risk from a power in the state legislatures over the elections of its house of , representatives than from their power of appointing the members of its . senate the senators are to be chosen for the period of six ; years there is to be a , rotation by which the seats of a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two ; years and no state is to be entitled to more than two ; senators a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen . members the joint result of these circumstances would , be that a temporary combination of a few states to intermit the appointment of , senators could neither annul the existence nor impair the activity of the ; body and it is not from a general and permanent combination of the states that we can have any thing to . fear the first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members of a few of the state ; legislatures the last would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the , people which will either never exist at , all or , will in all , probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general government to the advancement of their happiness in which event no good citizen could desire its . continuance but with regard to the federal house of , representatives there is intended to be a general election of members once in two . years if the state legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these , elections every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national , situation which might issue in a dissolution of the , union if the leaders of a few of the most important states should have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an . election i shall not , deny that there is a degree of weight in the , observation that the interests of each , state to be represented in the federal , councils will be a security against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of the state . legislatures but the security will not be considered as , complete by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between the interest of the people in the public , felicity and the interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of their . offices the people of america may be warmly attached to the government of the , union at times when the particular rulers of particular , states stimulated by the natural rivalship of , power and by the hopes of personal , aggrandizement and supported by a strong faction in each of those , states may be in a very opposite . temper this diversity of sentiment between a majority of the , people and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their , councils is exemplified in some of the states at the present , moment on the present . question the scheme of separate , confederacies which will always multiply the chances of , ambition will be a never failing bait to all such influential characters in the state administrations as are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public . weal with so effectual a weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating elections for the national , government a combination of a few such , men in a few of the most considerable , states where the temptation will always be the , strongest might accomplish the destruction of the , union by seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the people (and which perhaps they may themselves have , excited) to discontinue the choice of members for the federal house of . representatives it ought never to be , forgotten that a firm union of this , country under an efficient , government will probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one nation of ;

       "       \"an , objection of a nature different from that which has been stated and , answered in my last , address may perhaps be likewise urged against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens of . america it may be said that it would tend to render the government of the union too , powerful and to enable it to absorb those residuary , authorities which it might be judged proper to leave with the states for local . purposes allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can , require i confess i am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons intrusted with the administration of the general government could ever feel to divest the states of the authorities of that . description the regulation of the mere domestic police of a state appears to me to hold out slender allurements to . ambition , commerce , finance , negotiation and war seem to comprehend all the objects which have charms for minds governed by that ; passion and all the powers necessary to those objects , ought in the first , instance to be lodged in the national . depository the administration of private justice between the citizens of the same , state the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a similar , nature all those , things in , short which are proper to be provided for by local , legislation can never be desirable cares of a general . jurisdiction it is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which they are ; connected because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be ; nugatory and the possession of , them for that , reason would contribute nothing to the , dignity to the , importance or to the splendor of the national . government but let it be , admitted for argument's , sake that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that ; disposition still it may be safely , affirmed that the sense of the constituent body of the national , representatives , or in other , words the people of the several , states would control the indulgence of so extravagant an . appetite it will always be far more easy for the state governments to encroach upon the national authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the state . authorities the proof of this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence which the state governments if they administer their affairs with uprightness and , prudence will generally possess over the ; people a circumstance which at the same time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all federal ; constitutions and that too much pains cannot be taken in their , organization to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of . liberty the superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of the national , government but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the state administrations would be . directed it is a known fact in human , nature that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the . object upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his , neighborhood to his neighborhood than to the community at , large the people of each state would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the government of the ; union unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the . latter this strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of state . regulation the variety of more minute , interests which will necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local , administrations and which will form so many rivulets of , influence running through every part of the , society cannot be , particularized without involving a detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might . afford there is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the state , governments which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light,--i mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil . justice , this of all , others is the most , powerful most , universal and most attractive source of popular obedience and . attachment it is that , which being the immediate and visible guardian of life and , property having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity before the public , eye regulating all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately , awake , contributes more than any other , circumstance to impressing upon the minds of the , people , affection , esteem and reverence towards the . government this great cement of , society which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular , governments independent of all other causes of , influence would insure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them at all times a complete , counterpoise , and not , unfrequently dangerous rivals to the power of the . union the operations of the national , government on the other , hand falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the , citizens the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by speculative . men relating to more general , interests they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the ; people , and in , proportion less likely to inspire an habitual sense of , obligation and an active sentiment of . attachment the reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are , acquainted and of all others which have borne the least analogy to . them though the ancient feudal systems were , not strictly , speaking , confederacies yet they partook of the nature of that species of . association there was a common , head , chieftain or , sovereign whose authority extended over the whole ; nation and a number of subordinate , vassals or , feudatories who had large portions of land allotted to , them and numerous trains of inferior vassals or , retainers who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or , obedience to the persons of whom they held . it each principal vassal was a kind of , sovereign within his particular . demesnes the consequences of this situation were a continual opposition to authority of the , sovereign and frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories . themselves the power of the head of the nation was commonly too , weak either to preserve the public , peace or to protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate . lords this period of european affairs is emphatically styled by , historians the times of feudal . anarchy when the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of superior , abilities he would acquire a personal weight and , influence which , answered for the , time the purpose of a more regular . authority but in , general the power of the barons triumphed over that of the ; prince and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown , off and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or . states in those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his , vassals his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their . dependents the , barons or , nobles equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common , people were dreaded and detested by ; both till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the . aristocracy had the , nobles by a conduct of clemency and , justice preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and , followers the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their , favor and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal . authority this is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or . conjecture among other illustrations of its truth which might be , cited scotland will furnish a cogent . example the spirit of clanship which , was at an early , day introduced into that , kingdom uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those of , kindred rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the , monarch till the incorporation with england subdued its fierce and ungovernable , spirit and reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the latter . kingdom the separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal ; baronies with this advantage in their , favor that from the reasons already , explained they will generally possess the confidence and good-will of the , people and with so important a , support will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national . government it will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and necessary . authority the points of similitude consist in the rivalship of , power applicable to , both and in the concentration of large portions of the strength of the community into particular , depositories in one case at the disposal of , individuals in the other case at the disposal of political . bodies a concise review of the events that have attended confederate governments will further illustrate this important ;

       "       \"duration in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the executive . authority this has relation to two objects: to the personal firmness of the executive , magistrate in the employment of his constitutional ; powers and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his . auspices with regard to the , first it must be , evident that the longer the duration in , office the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an . advantage it is a general principle of human , nature that a man will be interested in whatever he , possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds ; it will be less attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain , title than to what he enjoys by a durable or certain ; title , and of , course will be willing to risk more for the sake of the , one than for the sake of the . other this remark is not less applicable to a political , privilege or , honor or , trust than to any article of ordinary . property the inference from it , is that a man acting in the capacity of chief , magistrate under a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his , office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or , perplexity from the independent exertion of his , powers or from encountering the , ill-humors however , transient which may happen to , prevail either in a considerable part of the society , itself or even in a predominant faction in the legislative . body if the case should only , be that he might lay it , down unless continued by a new , choice and if he should be desirous of being , continued his , wishes conspiring with his , fears would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his , integrity or debase his . fortitude in either , case feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the . station there are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the executive to a prevailing , current either in the community or in the , legislature as its best . recommendation but such men entertain very crude , notions as well of the purposes for which government was , instituted as of the true means by which the public happiness may be . promoted the republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their ; affairs but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of , passion or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of , men who flatter their prejudices to betray their . interests it is a just , observation that the people commonly intend the public . good this often applies to their very . errors but their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting . it they know from experience that they sometimes ; err and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they , do , beset as they continually , are by the wiles of parasites and , sycophants by the snares of the , ambitious the , avaricious the , desperate by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve , it and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve . it when occasions present , themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with their , inclinations it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those , interests to withstand the temporary , delusion in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate . reflection instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own , mistakes and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their . displeasure but however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the , people we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the . legislature the latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the , former and at other times the people may be entirely . neutral in either , supposition it is certainly desirable that the executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and . decision the same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of , power teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the . other to what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the , legislative if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the ? legislative such a separation must be merely , nominal and incapable of producing the ends for which it was . established it is one thing to be subordinate to the , laws and another to be dependent on the legislative . body the first comports , with the last , violates the fundamental principles of good ; government , and whatever may be the forms of the , constitution unites all power in the same . hands the tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every , other has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding . numbers in governments purely , republican this tendency is almost . irresistible the representatives of the , people in a popular , assembly seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people , themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other ; quarter as if the exercise of its , rights by either the executive or , judiciary were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their . dignity they often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other ; departments and as they commonly have the people on their , side they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the . constitution it may perhaps be , asked how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the executive on the , legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the . other one answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that , is from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived , advantage and the little inducement it affords him to expose , himself on account of , it to any considerable inconvenience or . hazard another , answer perhaps more , obvious though not more , conclusive will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the ; people which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man , who by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that , body should have made himself obnoxious to its . resentment it may be asked , also whether a duration of four years would answer the end ; proposed and if it would , not whether a less , period which would at least be recommended by greater security against ambitious , designs would , not for that , reason be preferable to a longer , period which , was at the same , time too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the . magistrate it cannot be , affirmed that a duration of four , years or any other limited , duration would completely answer the end ; proposed but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the . government between the commencement and termination of such a , period there would always be a considerable , interval in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently , remote not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of ; fortitude and in which he might reasonably promise , himself that there would be time enough before it , arrived to make the community sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to . pursue though it be probable , that as he approached the moment when the public , were by a new , election to signify their sense of his , conduct his , confidence and with it his , firmness would ; decline yet both the one and the other would derive support from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had afforded , him of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of his . constituents he , might , then hazard with , safety in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and , integrity and to the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his . fellow-citizens , as on the one , hand a duration of four years will contribute to the firmness of the executive in a sufficient degree to render it a very valuable ingredient in the ; composition , so on the , other it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public . liberty if a british house of , commons from the most feeble , beginnings from the mere power of assenting or disagreeing to the imposition of a new , tax , have by rapid , strides reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free , government while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the ; legislature if they have been , able in one , instance to abolish both the royalty and the , aristocracy and to overturn all the ancient , establishments as well in the church as ; state if they have been , able on a recent , occasion to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation(1) attempted by , them what would be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years' , duration with the confined authorities of a president of the united ? states , what but that he might be unequal to the task which the constitution assigns ? him i shall only , add that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his , firmness that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his . encroachments publius .
